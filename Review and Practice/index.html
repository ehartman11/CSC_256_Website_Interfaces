            <h2>A little about myself</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science major with minor experience with HTML, JS, C#, C/C++, 
                but I mostly work with Python and have worked quite a bit with VBA in excel and Batch. 
                I have created an app for tracking my newborn's habits using an M5StickC Plus2 
                microcomputer that pushes information to Google-Firebase Realtime Database, 
                my RaspberryPi4 periodically will perform ETL on records from the RT-DB into 
                its own local db then clears the RT-DB, I then can pull and clear from the 
                RaspberryPi4 from my laptop, view and modify the information in a self-made GUI. 
                I've also made an easy to use and update, personnel scheduler on excel using VBA, 
                a website hosted dice-game, web-crawlers using the Selenium extension for python 
                that pull quarterly financial statements and real-time stock prices from google 
                finance that I use to learn and practice data-science and analytics with pandas and numpy, 
                a CLI extension using python's argparse and pickle modules, and I am currently 
                working on a virtual boardgame using the pygame module.
